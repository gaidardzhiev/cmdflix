# CmdFlix

CmdFlix is a lightweight remote control server written in C for controlling Netflix playback on macOS using the Brave browser. It listens on a TCP port and accepts specially crafted HTTP GET requests to execute AppleScript commands that control browser actions and system volume.

---

### Features

- Activate or launch Brave Browser
- Play/Pause Netflix playback via space keypress
- Trigger Netflix "Next Episode" button click via JavaScript injection
- Adjust system volume up or down in increments of 5 units
- Simple HTTP server interface on port 30303

---

### How It Works

- **Networking:** Uses POSIX sockets to create a TCP server listening on port 30303. It accepts connections and reads HTTP GET requests.
- **HTTP Parsing:** The server parses incoming request strings for the pattern `/cmd?cmd=COMMAND`, extracting the requested command.
- **Command Validation:** Commands are validated against a white-list of allowed commands:
  - `brave_focus`
  - `brave_playpause`
  - `brave_netflix_next`
  - `volume_up`
  - `volume_down`
- **URL Decoding:** The GET parameters are URL decoded to support special characters.
- **AppleScript Integration:** For valid commands, a corresponding AppleScript string is generated and executed via popen():
  - Focus or launch Brave Browser
  - Send space key to toggle play/pause
  - Use JavaScript to click Netflix's next episode button
  - Adjust macOS system volume up/down by 5 units

- **Response Handling:** Returns HTTP 200 OK responses with success or error messages in HTML.
- **Static Serving:** Serves `index.html` for requests.

### Installation

Compile on macOS with:

`make`

Run with:

`./cmdflix`

Go to:

`localhost:30303`

---

### Usage

Send HTTP GET requests to control Netflix remotely:

- Focus Brave Browser: `http://localhost:30303/cmd?cmd=brave_focus`
- Play/Pause: `http://localhost:30303/cmd?cmd=brave_playpause`
- Next Episode: `http://localhost:30303/cmd?cmd=brave_netflix_next`
- Volume Up: `http://localhost:30303/cmd?cmd=volume_up`
- Volume Down: `http://localhost:30303/cmd?cmd=volume_down`

---

### Security

Only predefined commands are accepted, preventing arbitrary command execution. Avoid exposing this server to untrusted networks.

---

### Dependencies

- macOS with Brave Browser installed
- Standard C libraries and network/socket support
- AppleScript (`osascript`)

---

### Supported Commands & Effects

| Command             | Effect                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `brave_focus`       | Launches or focuses Brave Browser                   |

| `brave_netflix_next`| Executes JS to press Netflix's next episode button  |
| `volume_up`         | Increases system volume by 5 (max 100)              |
| `volume_down`       | Decreases system volume by 5 (min 0)                |

##  index.html

This is the simple web interface designed to control the Netflix playback remotely through `cmdflix` server. It communicates by sending HTTP GET requests with commands, providing a user friendly visual control panel.

---

### Layout and Styling

- The page uses a minimalist, style reminiscent of old terminal screens: black background with glowing green text and borders.
- The entire content is centered vertically and horizontally using flexbox for easy viewing on any screen size.
- Buttons are arranged in a neat 2x3 grid with spacing to separate control functions visually.
- Each button has a transparent background with green borders and text that glow and invert colors on hover for clear interactivity cues.
- The font uses monospace `'Courier New'`, which complements the terminal aesthetic.
- A status text area below the buttons displays feedback messages about the command sent and the server response.

---

### Controls and Interaction

- Five main buttons are provided:
  - Play / Pause
  - Next Track
  - Volume Up
  - Volume Down
  - Focus (to bring Brave browser to front)
- Each button has an `id` and a click event listener attached via JavaScript.

---

### JavaScript Functionality

- The `sendCommand(cmd)` function sends an asynchronous HTTP GET request to `/cmd?cmd=COMMAND` on the server for the given command.
- On clicking a button, the corresponding command string is passed to `sendCommand`.
- While the request is in progress, a status message shows "Sending [command]...".
- When the server responds:
  - If successful (HTTP 200), the returned response text is shown in the status area. 
  - If there's an error (non-200 status or request failure), an error message is displayed.

---

### How It Works Together

- The HTML front end presents an easy to use controller interface compatible with `cmdflix` command set.
- Users interact by clicking buttons; JavaScript sends the mapped commands over HTTP to the `cmdflix` server.
- `cmdflix` executes those commands on `macOS` to control Brave browser and volume as requested.
- Feedback from `cmdflix` is shown live to the user, giving clear and instant confirmation or error messages.
